        <h2>What is Space?</h2>
        <p>Space is the vast, seemingly infinite expanse that exists beyond our planet Earth. It is a vacuum, meaning it is almost entirely empty of matter, but it is far from nothing. Space contains galaxies, stars, planets, asteroids, comets, and a host of other celestial objects.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Galaxies</h2>
        <p>A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems, all held together by gravity. Our solar system is part of the Milky Way Galaxy, which contains over 100 billion stars.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Stars</h2>
        <p>Stars are giant, luminous spheres of plasma. They are born from clouds of dust and gas in space and generate light and heat through nuclear fusion in their cores. The closest star to Earth is the Sun, which provides the energy necessary for life on our planet.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Planets</h2>
        <p>Planets are large celestial bodies that orbit stars. Our solar system has eight recognized planets, including Earth. Each planet has its own unique characteristics, such as size, composition, and atmosphere.</p>

        <h2>The Expanding Universe</h2>
        <p>Space is not static; it is constantly expanding. This discovery, made in the 20th century, revolutionized our understanding of the universe. The expansion means that galaxies are moving away from each other, and it suggests that the universe had a beginning, often referred to as the Big Bang.</p>
